# A Mighty Fortress is Our God

---

A mighty fortress is our God,
a  bulwark never failing;
Our helper He, amid  the flood, 
of mortal ills prevailing:
For still our ancient foe, 
doth seek to work us woe;
His craft and power are great, 
and, armed with cruel hate,
On earth is not his equal. 

---

Did we in our own strength confide, 
our striving would be losing;
Were not the right Man on our side, 
the Man of God's own choosing:
Dost ask who that may be? 
Christ Jesus, it is He;
Lord Sab-a-oth, His Name, 
from age to age the same,
And He must win the bat-tle. 

---

And though this world, with devils filled,
should threaten to un-do  us,
We will not fear, for God hath willed,
His truth to triumph through us:
The prince of darkness grim,
we tremble not for him
His rage we can endure,
for lo, his doom is sure,
One little word will fell  him. 

---

That word above all earthly powers,
no thanks to them, abid-eth;
The Spirit and the gifts are ours,
through Him Who with us side-eth:
Let goods and kindred go,
this mortal life al-so;
The body they may kill: 
God's truth abideth still,
His kingdom is for ev - er.
